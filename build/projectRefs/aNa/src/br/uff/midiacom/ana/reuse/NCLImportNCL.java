/**
 * Class that represents an element used to import a document (importNCL).
 * 
 * <br/>
 * 
 * This element defines the attributes:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><i>alias</i> - name used to refer to the document referred in the attribute
 *                     documentURI. This attribute is required.</li>
 *  <li><i>documentURI</i> - URI of the document to be imported (if it is an
 *                           importNCL element) or the document that will have
 *                           its base imported (if it is an importBase element).
 *                           This attribute is required.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The alias attribute has to be unique in a document. An importing is transitive,
 * that is, if document A imports document B and it imports document C, then
 * document A imports document C. However, the alias defined to document C inside
 * document B is not considered by document A.
