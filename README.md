# STEVE
STEVE is a spatio-temporal view editor for authoring hypermedia applications. 

- It provides a temporal view of multimedia documents that allows users to graphically synchronize media nodes.
- It is designed for users with few or no knowledge of programming, multimedia/mulsemedia languages and standards. 
- Among existing mulsemedia solutions, my work is unique in that it explores the application 
level proposing a novel mulsemedia (multimedia with sensory effects) conceptual model.
